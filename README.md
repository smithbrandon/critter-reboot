Critterer
========================

The Creative Discovery Museum, Spartan Systems, and the Mozilla Foundation have 
teamed up to build an exciting new educational game. Our team consists of teen 
volunteers from the museum who will design, code, and build this app using HTML, 
CSS, and Javascript. Our plan is to build the app using PhoneGap to be deployed 
to both iOS and Android
